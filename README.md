## About

This script will read the output from the [human_phantom example](https://gitlab.cern.ch/geant4/geant4/tree/master/examples/advanced/human_phantom), and then retrieve the radiation exposure and calculate the following:

 * effective dose
 * equivalent dose
 * absorbed dose

And it will write these data to a csv file.
